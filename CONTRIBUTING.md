# Thank you for contributing to aihub
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, please add tests.
3. Keep documentation up to date.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project.
